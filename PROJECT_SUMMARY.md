### 🧠 Algorithm Implementation

**Seat Allocation Logic:**
```python
# Constants implemented
TOTAL_SEATS = 40  # 10 rows (A–J), 4 seats per row
SEAT_ROWS = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'H', 'I', 'J']
SEAT_COLS = [1, 2, 3, 4]
SEAT_ZONES = {
    'front': ['A', 'B', 'C'],
    'middle': ['D', 'E', 'F', 'G'],
    'back': ['H', 'I', 'J']
}
```

**Greedy Algorithm Features:**
- ✅ Shorter distance → front seats
- ✅ Longer distance → back seats
- ✅ Earlier bookings get priority
- ✅ Zone preference with fallback to any available seat

### 🌐 API Endpoints Implemented

- ✅ `GET /` - Landing page
- ✅ `GET /student` - Student booking page
- ✅ `GET /admin` - Admin dashboard
- ✅ `GET /api/routes` - Get all routes
- ✅ `GET /api/bookings` - Get all bookings
- ✅ `GET /api/buses` - Get bus information
- ✅ `POST /api/book` - Book a seat

### 📊 Data Format Implemented

**Routes (routes.csv):**
```csv
Destination,DistanceFromCollege,SeatZone
Rajpur Road,3,front
ISBT,7,middle
Clement Town,12,back
```

**Bookings (booking.csv):**
```csv
BookingID,StudentID,Name,Email,BusNumber,SeatNumber,TimeSlot,Destination,BookingDate,Status
```

**Buses (buses.csv):**
```csv
BusID,BusNumber,TimeSlot,TotalSeats,BookedSeats,AvailableSeats,IsReused,ReusedFrom
```
