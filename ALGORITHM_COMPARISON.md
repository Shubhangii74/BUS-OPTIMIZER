# Seat Allocation Algorithm Comparison

## Overview
This document compares different optimization techniques for bus seat allocation in the Bus Optimizer system.

## 1. Greedy Algorithm (Current Implementation)

### How it Works:
- **Zone-based allocation**: Assigns seats based on destination preferences
- **First-fit approach**: Takes the first available seat in preferred zone
- **Real-time processing**: Allocates seats immediately upon booking

### Algorithm Steps:
1. Determine destination zone (front/middle/back)
2. Find bus for the time slot
3. Get all booked seats
4. Search for available seat in preferred zone first
5. Fallback to any available seat if preferred zone is full

### Code Implementation:
```python
def get_available_seat(time_slot, destination):
    # Get destination zone
    # Find bus for time slot
    # Get booked seats
    # Try preferred zone first
    # Fallback to any available seat
```

### Performance Metrics:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) where n = number of seats
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for storing booked seats
- **Optimality**: Local optimal (may not be globally optimal)
- **Real-time**: ✅ Yes
- **Scalability**: ✅ Good for real-time bookings

### Pros:
- ✅ Simple and fast
- ✅ Real-time allocation
- ✅ Easy to understand and maintain
- ✅ Low computational overhead
- ✅ Works well for individual bookings

### Cons:
- ❌ May not find globally optimal solution
- ❌ Doesn't consider future bookings
- ❌ No batch optimization
- ❌ May lead to suboptimal seat distribution

## 2. 0/1 Knapsack Approach

### How it Works:
- **Value-based allocation**: Each seat has a preference score
- **Optimization goal**: Maximize total satisfaction score
- **Constraint**: Limited seats (knapsack capacity = 40)

### Algorithm Steps:
1. Calculate preference score for each available seat
2. Sort seats by preference score (descending)
3. Select seat with highest score
4. Update booking status

### Code Implementation:
```python
def knapsack_seat_allocation(time_slot, destination, student_id):
    # Calculate preference scores for all available seats
    # Sort by preference score
    # Return best available seat
```

### Performance Metrics:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) for sorting
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for storing seat preferences
- **Optimality**: Better than greedy for individual bookings
- **Real-time**: ✅ Yes
- **Scalability**: ✅ Good

### Pros:
- ✅ Better optimization than greedy
- ✅ Considers seat preferences quantitatively
- ✅ More sophisticated scoring system
- ✅ Still real-time capable

### Cons:
- ❌ Still not globally optimal
- ❌ Doesn't consider batch bookings
- ❌ Higher computational cost than greedy

## 3. Dynamic Programming Knapsack (Full Implementation)

### How it Works:
- **Batch optimization**: Processes multiple bookings simultaneously
- **Global optimization**: Finds optimal allocation for all pending bookings
- **DP approach**: Uses memoization for efficiency

### Algorithm Steps:
1. Collect all pending bookings for a time slot
2. Create items with values (preference scores) and weights
3. Apply 0/1 Knapsack DP algorithm
4. Allocate seats to maximize total satisfaction

### Code Implementation:
```python
def dynamic_programming_knapsack_seat_allocation(time_slot, destination, student_id):
    # Get all pending bookings
    # Create items with preference scores
    # Apply DP Knapsack algorithm
    # Return optimal allocation
```

### Performance Metrics:
- **Time Complexity**: O(nW) where n = bookings, W = seats
- **Space Complexity**: O(nW) for DP table
- **Optimality**: Globally optimal for batch processing
- **Real-time**: ❌ No (batch processing)
- **Scalability**: ⚠️ Limited by computational complexity

### Pros:
- ✅ Globally optimal solution
- ✅ Best overall satisfaction
- ✅ Considers all bookings together
- ✅ Sophisticated optimization

### Cons:
- ❌ Higher computational complexity
- ❌ Not suitable for real-time processing
- ❌ Requires batch processing
- ❌ Memory intensive for large datasets

## 4. Additional Optimization Techniques

### A. Genetic Algorithm
- **Approach**: Evolutionary optimization
- **Use Case**: Complex multi-objective optimization
- **Pros**: Can handle multiple constraints
- **Cons**: Complex implementation, not real-time

### B. Linear Programming
- **Approach**: Mathematical optimization
- **Use Case**: Resource allocation problems
- **Pros**: Guaranteed optimal solution
- **Cons**: Requires specialized solvers

### C. Simulated Annealing
- **Approach**: Probabilistic optimization
- **Use Case**: Large-scale optimization problems
- **Pros**: Can escape local optima
- **Cons**: Requires parameter tuning

## Recommendation

### For Current System (Real-time Bookings):
**Use Greedy Algorithm** because:
- ✅ Fast and efficient
- ✅ Real-time processing
- ✅ Simple to maintain
- ✅ Good user experience

### For Batch Processing:
**Use 0/1 Knapsack with DP** because:
- ✅ Globally optimal
- ✅ Better resource utilization
- ✅ Higher satisfaction scores

### Hybrid Approach:
1. **Real-time**: Use Greedy for immediate bookings
2. **Batch**: Use DP Knapsack for optimization runs
3. **Periodic**: Re-optimize using batch processing

- ✅ **0/1 Knapsack**: Implemented with preference scoring
- ⚠️ **DP Knapsack**: Framework implemented, needs full DP algorithm
- ❌ **Other Algorithms**: Not implemented

## Configuration

To switch algorithms, change the `ALLOCATION_ALGORITHM` constant in `app.py`:

```python
ALLOCATION_ALGORITHM = 'greedy'      # Current default
ALLOCATION_ALGORITHM = 'knapsack'    # 0/1 Knapsack approach
ALLOCATION_ALGORITHM = 'dp_knapsack' # Dynamic Programming (future)
```
